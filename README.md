# Grouping Selectors Assignment

In this assignment, I focused on utilizing CSS class selectors and grouping selectors to style two elements in an HTML file. The goal was to apply shared and unique styles to these elements by using a combination of CSS properties, class names, and grouping selectors. By doing so, we learned how to efficiently apply styles to multiple elements without repetition.
Objective

# The objective of this exercise was to:
Assign unique class names to two HTML elements.
Apply shared styles to both elements using a grouping selector.
Apply unique styles to each element using their respective class names.
Steps Followed

## 1. Create Two HTML Elements with Unique Class Names
First Element: A black background with white text.
Second Element: A yellow background.
Both elements shared a font size of 28px and a font-family list that includes Helvetica, Times New Roman, and a fallback of sans-serif.
## 2. Grouping Selectors for Shared Styles
For the styles that are shared between both elements (font size and font family), a grouping selector was used. This allowed both elements to inherit the same font properties without needing to duplicate the styles for each class.
## 3. Unique Styles for Each Element
Unique styles were applied separately to each element. The first element received a black background with white text, while the second element received a yellow background.
